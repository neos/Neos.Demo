                                                    would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
                                                    when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</text>

                                                    much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &quot;Oh dear!

                                                    her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
                                                    seemed quite

                                                    across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either

                                                    waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
                                                    curiosity, she
                                                    ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop
                                                    down a large
                                                    rabbit-hole under the hedge.

                                                    slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about
                                                    her, and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried
                                                    to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too
                                                    dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and
                                                    noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here
                                                    and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a
                                                    jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &quot;ORANGE
                                                    MARMALADE,&quot; but to her disappointment it was empty; she did not
                                                    like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so
                                                    managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.

                                                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that a website does not only contain static
                                                parts. In today's world, you often integrate external services, have to
                                                model complex business logic or tweak the output of the website in a
                                                very fine-grained way. That's why our main goal is developer happiness.
                                                We want you to be effective, being able to re-use concepts and code
                                                across your websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that is no free ride:
                                                You need to learn the concepts used in Neos. However, by implementing
                                                established practices in software development, your knowledge can be
                                                applied to a wide variety of languages, frameworks and use-cases. We
                                                want to help you become better programmers!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;The
                                                Learn Once, Run Everywhere Philosophy is the main guidance principle for
                                                the development of Neos: All components are usable inside the CMS
                                                context, but also in stand-alone web applications. That of course also
                                                includes your own components.&lt;/div&gt;</text>

                                                were its main engine. It powers many foundational features for building
                                                extensible and adjustable web applications of today, such as Dependency
                                                Injection, Aspect-Oriented Programming and a unique
                                                Model-View-Controller Framework. And best of all: Everything is usable
                                                directly in Neos, should you ever need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow has
                                                first-class support for Domain-Driven Design: It helps you to focus on
                                                the problem domain of your customer, shielding you from implementation
                                                details until you need them. Worried about form validation, security,
                                                file-uploads or logging? All directly built into Flow. Couple that with
                                                powerful, composer-based package management and a doctrine-based
                                                persistence layer, and you can build on the shoulders of giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You
                                                might wonder whether it was worth to develop Flow from scratch. But if
                                                you try it out and experience the flow-feeling of development, you will
                                                see what we mean with it.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neos can easily be extended with plugins, which are
                                                just standard packages of Flow with a little extra configuration.  The
                                                same works for backend modules. By using convention over configuration,
                                                the required settings you need to do boils down to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of
                                                course we know that the there's one thing where you need full control:
                                                The rendering of your website. In Neos, a custom package called
                                                Fusion powers the rendering process, allowing for fine-grained
                                                control over the output. No need to override complete templates or hack
                                                the source.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                                discover it yourself! All contents are directly edited on the page, just
                                                styled like the live content. Powered by Aloha Editor and Hallo Editor,
                                                you'll directly see what you write, just as the end-user does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,
                                                the editing is based on semantic technologies such as RDFa, which we
                                                consume using VIE and CreateJS. This allows to expose the whole content
                                                of your website in a machine-readable way, should you ever need that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You
                                                also see Neos is not just developed by the core team, but we're also
                                                using and contributing to other, shared projects.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                                &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Neos still stores its data in a relational
                                                database, you won't access this directly when working with content.
                                                Instead, we're using a tree-based approach of storing content which we
                                                call the Neos Content Repository (CR). This tree enables you to not only
                                                structure your content using a page tree, but also nest content into
                                                other content in a page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Content
                                                Repository allows you to easily create new content elements, just using
                                                a Fluid Template, one line of Fusion Code and a few lines of
                                                configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

            <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;The first question of course was, how to
                                                    get dry again: they had a
                                                    consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
                                                    natural to
                                                    Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
                                                    known them all
                                                    her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who
                                                    at last
                                                    turned sulky, and would only say, &quot;I am older than you, and
                                                    must know
                                                    better;&quot; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old
                                                    it was,
                                                    and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
                                                    more to be
                                                    said.

                                                    hurried off at once; one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very

                                                    of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping

                                                    Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.

                                            entirely new cities. Cities where development has not even started. Cities
                                            that can draw from all we know about liveability and functionality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            same goes for websites. Major websites will be built with the tools we’re
                                            constructing today. But we don't know how they will be like. Just think of
                                            how different sites were 3 years ago. For both cities and websites, one
                                            basic rule counts: Things are constantly changing and can never be fully
                                            anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inspiration from urban planning permeates
                                            our UX master plan, giving us crucial guidelines for structuring everything
                                            we know  - and making room for all the future change we don’t know.  &lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distribution of power in a city makes sure that
                                            everyone gets what they need. You don’t power a shed in the way you power a
                                            nuclear plant. The ultra-simple editing already available in the alpha makes
                                            editors center their attention on content. If you need to add SEO data next
                                            to the content, Neos has an inspector that opens up for that kind of
                                            functionality. Just a bit more power, one step at a time... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If
                                            you need more, the inspector will be expandable to the full backend screen
                                            providing the user with all the options. That’s not enough? Create custom
                                            backend modules. And if even that's not enough, underlying Neos, we have
                                            Flow - a first-class web framework that enables you to build web
                                            applications that integrate with your other systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting
                                            by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she
                                            had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
                                            conversations in it, &quot;and what is the use of a book,&quot; thought
                                            Alice, &quot;without pictures or conversations?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;So she was
                                            considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her
                                            feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain
                                            would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
                                            suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
                                            was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much
                                            out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear! I
                                            shall be too late!&quot; (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred
                                            to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all
                                            seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
                                            waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
                                            her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a
                                            rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and
                                            burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in
                                            time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
                                            another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the
                                            world she was to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rabbit-hole went
                                            straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so
                                            suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before
                                            she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either
                                            the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time
                                            as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen
                                            next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but
                                            it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well
                                            and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and
                                            there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one
                                            of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled &quot;ORANGE MARMALADE,&quot;
                                            but to her disappointment it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar for
                                            fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
                                            cupboards as she fell past it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well!&quot; thought
                                            Alice to herself. &quot;After such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
                                            tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I
                                            wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!&quot;
                                            (Which was very likely true.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down, down, down. Would the
                                            fall never come to an end? &quot;I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this
                                            time?&quot; she said aloud. &quot;I must be getting somewhere near the
                                            centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down. I
                                            think—&quot; (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
                                            her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good
                                            opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
                                            her, still it was good practice to say it over) &quot;—yes, that's about the
                                            right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?&quot;
                                            (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they
                                            were nice grand words to say.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently she began again.
                                            &quot;I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem
                                            to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards! The
                                            Antipathies, I think—&quot; (she was rather glad there was no one listening,
                                            this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) &quot;—but I shall have
                                            to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is
                                            this New Zealand or Australia?&quot; (and she tried to curtsey as she
                                            spoke—fancy curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you
                                            could manage it?) &quot;And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me!
                                            No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down,
                                            down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again.
                                            &quot;Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!&quot; (Dinah was
                                            the cat.) &quot;I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time.
                                            Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the
                                            air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse,
                                            you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&quot; And here Alice began to get
                                            rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way,
                                            &quot;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&quot; and sometimes, &quot;Do bats
                                            eat cats?&quot; for, you see, as she
                                            couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.
                                            She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
                                            walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, &quot;Now,
                                            Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?&quot; when suddenly,
                                            thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the
                                            fall was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up
                                            on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead;
                                            before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
                                            sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice
                                            like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,
                                            &quot;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!&quot; She was close
                                            behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be
                                            seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
                                            lamps hanging from the roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were doors all round
                                            the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down
                                            one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the
                                            middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly
                                            she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there
                                            was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that
                                            this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the
                                            locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not
                                            open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
                                            curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about
                                            fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her
                                            great delight it fitted!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice opened the door and found
                                            that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt
                                            down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
                                            How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those
                                            beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get
                                            her head through the doorway; Mollie even if my head would go through,&quot;
                                            thought poor Alice, &quot;it would be of very little use without my
                                            shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could,
                                            if I only knew how to begin.&quot; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
                                            things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
                                            things indeed were really impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be
                                            no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half
                                            hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for
                                            shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on
                                            it (&quot;which certainly was not here before,&quot; said Alice,) and tied
                                            round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words &quot;DRINK
                                            ME&quot; beautifully printed on it in large letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
                                            was all very well to say &quot;Drink me,&quot; but the wise little Alice was
                                            not going to do that in a hurry. &quot;No, I'll look first,&quot; she said,
                                            &quot;and see whether it's marked 'poison' or not;&quot; for she had read
                                            several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up
                                            by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they would not
                                            remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
                                            red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut
                                            your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
                                            forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked &quot;poison,&quot;
                                            it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,
                                            this bottle was not marked &quot;poison,&quot; so Alice ventured to taste
                                            it, and finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of
                                            cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, coffee, and hot buttered
                                            toast,) she very soon finished it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a
                                            curious feeling!&quot; said Alice. &quot;I must be shutting up like a
                                            telescope.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so it was indeed: she was now only
                                            ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now
                                            the right size for going through that little door into that lovely garden.
                                            First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to
                                            shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this: &quot;for it might
                                            end, you know,&quot; said Alice to herself, &quot;in my going out
                                            altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?&quot; And
                                            she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is
                                            blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After
                                            a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the
                                            garden at once; but,
                                            alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten
                                            the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found
                                            she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the
                                            glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but
                                            it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the
                                            poor little thing sat down and cried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come, there's
                                            no use in crying like that!&quot; said Alice to herself, rather sharply.
                                            &quot;I advise you to leave off this minute!&quot; She generally gave
                                            herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes
                                            she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once
                                            she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a
                                            game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was
                                            very fond of pretending to be two people. &quot;But it's no use now,&quot;
                                            thought poor Alice, &quot;to pretend to be two people! Why there's hardly
                                            enough of me left to make one respectable person!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon
                                            her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she
                                            opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words &quot;EAT
                                            ME&quot; were beautifully marked in currants. &quot;Well, I'll eat it,&quot;
                                            said Alice, &quot;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and
                                            if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll
                                            get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She
                                            ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &quot;Which way? Which way?&quot;
                                            holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing,
                                            and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size; to be
                                            sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got
                                            so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to
                                            happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common
                                            way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she set to work, and very soon finished off the
                                            cake.&lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                            was so much surprised, that for a moment she quite forgot how to speak good
                                            English); &quot;now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever
                                            was! Good-bye, feet!&quot; (for when she looked down at her feet, they
                                            seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). &quot;Oh,
                                            my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for
                                            you now, dears? I'm sure I sha'n't be able! I shall be a great deal too far
                                            off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can—but I
                                            must be kind to them,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;or perhaps they won't walk
                                            the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every
                                            Christmas.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;And she went on planning to herself how she would
                                            manage it. &quot;They must go by the carrier,&quot; she thought; &quot;and
                                            how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the
                                            directions will look!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice's Right Foot, Esq.&lt;br/&gt;Hearthrug,&lt;br/&gt;near
                                            the Fender,&lt;br/&gt;(with Alice's love).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oh dear, what
                                            nonsense I'm talking!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Just then her head struck against the
                                            roof of the hall: in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high, and
                                            she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden
                                            door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor Alice! It was as much as she could
                                            do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye;
                                            but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to
                                            cry again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You ought to be ashamed of
                                            yourself,&quot; said Alice, &quot;a great girl like you&quot; (she might
                                            well say this), &quot;to go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell
                                            you!&quot; But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until
                                            there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching
                                            half down the hall.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curiouser and Curiouser
                                            Curiouser and Curiouser&lt;br/&gt;After a time she heard a little pattering
                                            of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was
                                            coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair
                                            of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came
                                            trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, &quot;Oh!
                                            the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!&quot;
                                            Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when
                                            the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, &quot;If you
                                            please, sir——&quot; The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid
                                            gloves and the fan, and scurried away into the darkness as hard as he could
                                            go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as
                                            the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on
                                            talking! &quot;Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday
                                            things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed during the
                                            night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost
                                            think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same,
                                            the next question is, who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!&quot;
                                            And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same
                                            age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm
                                            sure I'm not Ada,&quot; she said, &quot;for her hair goes in such long
                                            ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be
                                            Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very
                                            little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is!
                                            I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times
                                            five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh
                                            dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication
                                            Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris,
                                            and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that's all wrong, I'm
                                            certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I'll try and say 'How doth the
                                            little——'&quot; and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying
                                            lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange,
                                            and the words did not come the same as they used to do:—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How
                                            doth the little crocodile&lt;br/&gt;Improve his shining tail,&lt;br/&gt;And
                                            pour the waters of the Nile&lt;br/&gt;On every golden scale!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How
                                            cheerfully he seems to grin,&lt;br/&gt;How neatly spreads his claws,&lt;br/&gt;And
                                            welcomes little fishes in,&lt;br/&gt;With gently smiling jaws!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                                            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm sure those are not the right words,&quot; said
                                            poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on.
                                            &quot;I must be Mabel, after all, and I shall have to go and live in that
                                            poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so
                                            many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll
                                            stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying,
                                            'Come up again, dear!' I shall only look up and say, 'Who am I then? Tell me
                                            that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not,
                                            I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else'—but, oh dear!&quot; cried Alice
                                            with a sudden burst of tears, &quot;I do wish they would put their heads
                                            down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
                                            she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that
                                            she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was
                                            talking. &quot;How can I have done that?&quot; she thought. &quot;I must be
                                            growing small again.&quot; She got up and went to the table to measure
                                            herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now
                                            about two feet high, and was&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; going on shrinking rapidly:
                                            she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and
                                            she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was a
                                            narrow escape!&quot; said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden
                                            change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; &quot;and now for
                                            the garden!&quot; and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but
                                            alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on
                                            the glass table as before, &quot;and things are worse than ever,&quot;
                                            thought the poor child, &quot;for I never was so small as this before,
                                            never! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
                                            she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she
                                            was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow
                                            fallen into the sea, &quot;and in that case I can go back by railway,&quot;
                                            she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and
                                            had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English
                                            coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children
                                            digging in the sand with wooden spades, then&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a row of
                                            lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made
                                            out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
                                            feet high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wish I hadn't cried so much!&quot; said
                                            Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. &quot;I shall be
                                            punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
                                            That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just
                                            then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and
                                            she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a
                                            walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and
                                            she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would
                                            it be of any use now,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;to speak to this mouse?
                                            Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely
                                            it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.&quot; So she began:
                                            &quot;O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of
                                            swimming about here, O Mouse!&quot; (Alice thought this must&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                                            be the right way of speaking to a mouse; she had never done such a thing
                                            before, but she remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar,
                                            &quot;A mouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!&quot;) The Mouse looked
                                            at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its
                                            little eyes, but it said nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps it doesn't
                                            understand English,&quot; thought Alice; &quot;I daresay it's a French
                                            mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.&quot; (For, with all her
                                            knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything
                                            had happened.) So she began again: &quot;Où est ma chatte?&quot; which was
                                            the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap
                                            out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. &quot;Oh, I beg
                                            your pardon!&quot; cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor
                                            animal's feelings. &quot;I quite forgot you didn't like cats.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            like cats!&quot; cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. &quot;Would you like
                                            cats if you were me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, perhaps not,&quot;
                                            said Alice in a soothing tone: &quot;don't be angry about it. And yet&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                                            I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if
                                            you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,&quot; Alice went on,
                                            half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, &quot;and
                                            she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her
                                            face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she's such a capital one
                                            for catching mice——oh, I beg your pardon!&quot; cried Alice again, for this
                                            time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be
                                            really offended. &quot;We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We,
                                            indeed!&quot; cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
                                            tail. &quot;As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family
                                            always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name
                                            again!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I won't indeed!&quot; said Alice, in a
                                            great hurry to change the subject of conversation. &quot;Are you—are you
                                            fond—of—of dogs?&quot; The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:
                                            &quot;There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show
                                            you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown
                                            hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg
                                            for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can't remember half of them—and it
                                            belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a
                                            hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!&quot; cried Alice
                                            in a sorrowful tone, &quot;I'm afraid I've offended it again!&quot; For the
                                            Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a
                                            commotion in the pool as it went.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she called
                                            softly after it, &quot;Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk
                                            about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When
                                            the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
                                            was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling
                                            voice, &quot;Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and
                                            you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
                                            was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds
                                            and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory
                                            and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and
                                            the whole party swam to the shore.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;T HEY were indeed a queer-looking party that
                                            assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with
                                            their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
                                            uncomfortable.&lt;br/&gt;The first question of course was, how to get dry
                                            again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed
                                            quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
                                            she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with
                                            the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, &quot;I am older
                                            than you, and must know better;&quot; and this Alice would not allow without
                                            knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age,
                                            there was no more to be said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last the
                                            Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out &quot;Sit
                                            down, all of you, and listen to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!&quot;
                                            They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.
                                            Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch
                                            a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahem!&quot;
                                            said the Mouse with an important air. &quot;Are you all ready? This is the
                                            driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! 'William the
                                            Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by
                                            the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to
                                            usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and
                                            Northumbria—'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ugh!&quot; said the
                                            Lory, with a shiver.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I beg your pardon!&quot;
                                            said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely. &quot;Did you speak?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            I!&quot; said the Lory hastily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought
                                            you did,&quot; said the Mouse, &quot;—I proceed. 'Edwin and Morcar, the
                                            earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the
                                            patriotic Archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Found
                                            what?&quot; said the Duck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Found it,&quot;
                                            the Mouse replied rather crossly: &quot;of course you know what 'it' means.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            know what 'it' means well enough, when I find a thing,&quot; said the Duck;
                                            &quot;it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the
                                            archbishop find?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mouse did not notice
                                            this question, but hurriedly went on, &quot;'—found it advisable to go with
                                            Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William's conduct at
                                            first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—' How are you getting
                                            on now, my dear?&quot; it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As
                                            wet as ever,&quot; said Alice in a melancholy tone; &quot;doesn't seem to
                                            dry me at all.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In that case,&quot;
                                            said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, &quot;I move that the meeting
                                            adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Speak
                                            English!&quot; said the Eaglet. &quot;I don't know the meaning of half those
                                            long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!&quot; And the
                                            Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered
                                            audibly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I was going to say,&quot;
                                            said the Dodo in an offended tone, &quot;was that the best thing to get us
                                            dry would be a Caucus-race.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is
                                            a Caucus-race?&quot; said Alice; not that she much wanted to know, but the
                                            Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one
                                            else seemed inclined to say anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why,&quot;
                                            said the Dodo, &quot;the best way to explain it is to do it.&quot; (And, as
                                            you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day, I will tell you
                                            how the Dodo managed it.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First it marked out a
                                            race-course, in a sort of circle, (&quot;the exact shape doesn't matter,&quot;
                                            it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and
                                            there. There was no &quot;One, two, three, and away,&quot; but they began
                                            running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not
                                            easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running
                                            half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
                                            &quot;The race is over!&quot; and they all crowded round it, panting, and
                                            asking &quot;But who has won?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
                                            question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it
                                            stood for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the
                                            position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of
                                            him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said &quot;Everybody
                                            has won, and all must have prizes.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            who is to give the prizes?&quot; quite a chorus of voices asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why,
                                            she, of course,&quot; said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and
                                            the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way,
                                            &quot;Prizes! Prizes!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice had no idea
                                            what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a
                                            box of comfits (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them
                                            round as prizes. There was exactly one apiece all round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                                            &quot;But she must have a prize herself, you know,&quot; said the Mouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            course,&quot; the Dodo replied very gravely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            else have you got in your pocket?&quot; it went on, turning to Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only
                                            a thimble,&quot; said Alice sadly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hand
                                            it over here,&quot; said the Dodo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they
                                            all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the
                                            thimble, saying &quot;We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble;&quot;
                                            and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she
                                            did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she
                                            simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            next thing was to eat the comfits; this caused some noise and confusion, as
                                            the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small
                                            ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last,
                                            and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them
                                            something more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You promised to tell me
                                            your history, you know,&quot; said Alice, &quot;and why it is you hate—C and
                                            D,&quot; she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended
                                            again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;Mine is a long and sad
                                            tale!&quot; said the Mouse, turning to Alice and sighing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            is a long tail, certainly,&quot; said Alice, looking down with wonder at the
                                            Mouse's tail; &quot;but why do you call it sad?&quot; And she kept on
                                            puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale
                                            was something like this:—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fury said to &lt;br/&gt;a
                                            mouse, That &lt;br/&gt;he met in the &lt;br/&gt;house, 'Let &lt;br/&gt;us
                                            both go &lt;br/&gt;to law: I &lt;br/&gt;will prose-&lt;br/&gt;cute you. —
                                            &lt;br/&gt;Come, I'll &lt;br/&gt;take no de-&lt;br/&gt;nial: We &lt;br/&gt;must
                                            have&lt;br/&gt;the trial;&lt;br/&gt;For really&lt;br/&gt;this morn-&lt;br/&gt;ing
                                            I've&lt;br/&gt;nothing&lt;br/&gt;to do.'&lt;br/&gt;Said the&lt;br/&gt;mouse
                                            to&lt;br/&gt;the cur,&lt;br/&gt;'Such a&lt;br/&gt;trial, dear&lt;br/&gt;sir,
                                            With&lt;br/&gt;no jury&lt;br/&gt;or judge,&lt;br/&gt;would&lt;br/&gt;be

                                            be&lt;br/&gt;jury,'&lt;br/&gt;said&lt;br/&gt;cun-&lt;br/&gt;ning&lt;br/&gt;old&lt;br/&gt;Fury:&lt;br/&gt;'I'll&lt;br/&gt;try&lt;br/&gt;the&lt;br/&gt;whole&lt;br/&gt;cause,&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;con-&lt;br/&gt;demn&lt;br/&gt;you
                                            to&lt;br/&gt;death.'&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are not
                                            attending!&quot; said the Mouse to Alice severely. &quot;What are you
                                            thinking of?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot;
                                            said Alice very humbly: &quot;you had got to the fifth bend, I think?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            had not!&quot; cried the Mouse, angrily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A
                                            knot!&quot; said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
                                            anxiously about her. &quot;Oh, do let me help to undo it!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            shall do nothing of the sort,&quot; said the Mouse, getting up and walking
                                            away. &quot;You insult me by talking such nonsense!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            didn't mean it!&quot; pleaded poor Alice. &quot;But you're so easily
                                            offended, you know!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mouse only
                                            growled in reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please come back and
                                            finish your story!&quot; Alice called after it. And the others all joined in
                                            chorus, &quot;Yes, please do!&quot; but the Mouse only shook its head
                                            impatiently and walked a little quicker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            a pity it wouldn't stay!&quot; sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out
                                            of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter,
                                            &quot;Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!&quot;
                                            &quot;Hold your
                                            tongue, Ma!&quot; said the young Crab, a little snappishly. &quot;You're
                                            enough to try the patience of an oyster!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!&quot; said Alice aloud, addressing
                                            nobody in particular. &quot;She'd soon fetch it back!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?&quot; said the Lory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: &quot;Dinah's
                                            our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching mice, you ca'n't think!
                                            And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little
                                            bird as soon as look at it!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This speech
                                            caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off
                                            at once; one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking
                                            &quot;I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!&quot;
                                            and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children &quot;Come
                                            away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!&quot; On various
                                            pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!&quot; she said to herself in a melancholy
                                            tone. &quot;Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best
                                            cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any
                                            more!&quot; And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely
                                            and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little
                                            pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half
                                            hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish
                                            his story.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                                            &lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                            guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white
                                            kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
                                            they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her
                                            swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little
                                            door, had vanished completely.&lt;br/&gt;Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice,
                                            as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, &quot;Why,
                                            Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a
                                            pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!&quot; And Alice was so much frightened
                                            that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to
                                            explain the mistake it had made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He took
                                            me for his housemaid,&quot; she said to herself as she ran. &quot;How
                                            surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd better take him his
                                            fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.&quot; As she said this, she came
                                            upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with
                                            the name &quot;W. RABBIT&quot; engraved upon it. She went in without
                                            knocking, and hurried up stairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real
                                            Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
                                            gloves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How queer it seems,&quot; Alice said to
                                            herself, &quot;to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be
                                            sending me on messages next!&quot; And she began fancying the sort of thing
                                            that would happen: &quot;'Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for
                                            your walk!' 'Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to watch this
                                            mouse-hole till Dinah comes back, and see that the mouse doesn't get out.'
                                            Only I don't think,&quot; Alice went on, &quot;that they'd let Dinah stop in
                                            the house if it began ordering people about like that!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By
                                            this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the
                                            window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny
                                            white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just
                                            going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood
                                            near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words &quot;DRINK
                                            ME,&quot; but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. &quot;I
                                            know something interesting is sure to happen,&quot; she said to herself,
                                            &quot;whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle
                                            does. I do hope it will make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired
                                            of being such a tiny little thing!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did
                                            so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half
                                            the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to
                                            stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle,
                                            saying to herself &quot;That's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't grow any
                                            more—As it is, I can't get out at the door—I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so
                                            much!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas! it was too late to wish that!
                                            She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the
                                            floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the
                                            effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm
                                            curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource,
                                            she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to
                                            herself &quot;Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of
                                            me?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Alice, the little magic
                                            bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was
                                            very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever
                                            getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            was much pleasanter at home,&quot; thought poor Alice, &quot;when one wasn't
                                            always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
                                            rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and
                                            yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can
                                            have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of
                                            thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to
                                            be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write
                                            one—but I'm grown up now,&quot; she added in a sorrowful tone; &quot;at
                                            least there's no room to grow up any more here.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            then,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;shall I
                                            never get any older than I am now? That'll be a comfort, one way—never to be
                                            an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like
                                            that!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, you foolish Alice!&quot;
                                            she answered herself. &quot;How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's
                                            hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And
                                            so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a
                                            conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice
                                            outside, and stopped to listen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mary Ann!
                                            Mary Ann!&quot; said the voice. &quot;Fetch me my gloves this moment!&quot;
                                            Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the
                                            Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house,
                                            quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the
                                            Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presently
                                            the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door
                                            opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt
                                            proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself &quot;Then I'll go round and
                                            get in at the window.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That you
                                            won't&quot; thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the
                                            Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a
                                            snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little
                                            shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded
                                            that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
                                            of the sort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next came an angry voice—the
                                            Rabbit's—&quot;Pat! Pat! Where are you?&quot; And then a voice she had never
                                            heard before, &quot;Sure then I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Digging
                                            for apples, indeed!&quot; said the Rabbit angrily. &quot;Here! Come and help
                                            me out of this!&quot; (Sounds of more broken glass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now
                                            tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure,
                                            it's an arm, yer honour.&quot; (He pronounced it &quot;arrum.&quot;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An
                                            arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sure,
                                            it does, yer honour? but it's an arm for all that.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
                                            was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and
                                            then; such as, &quot;Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!&quot;
                                            &quot;Do as I tell you, you coward!&quot; and at last she spread out her
                                            hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two
                                            little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. &quot;What a number of
                                            cucumber-frames there must be!&quot; thought Alice. &quot;I wonder what
                                            they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they
                                            could! I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She
                                            waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling
                                            of little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking
                                            together: she made out the words: &quot;Where's the other ladder?—Why I
                                            hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other—Bill! Fetch it here,
                                            lad!—Here, put 'em up at this corner—No, tie 'em together first—they don't
                                            reach half high enough yet—Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be
                                            particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that
                                            loose slate—Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!&quot; (a loud crash)—&quot;Now,
                                            who did that?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who's to go down the chimney?—Nay, I
                                            sha'n't! You do it!—That I won't, then! Bill's to go down—Here, Bill! the
                                            master says you've to go down the chimney!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh!
                                            So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?&quot; said Alice to herself.
                                            &quot;Why, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's
                                            place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I
                                            can kick a little!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She drew her foot as
                                            far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal
                                            (she couldn't guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in
                                            the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself &quot;This is Bill,&quot;
                                            she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            first thing she heard was a general chorus of &quot;There goes Bill!&quot;
                                            then the Rabbit's voice alone—&quot;Catch him, you by the hedge!&quot; then
                                            silence, and then another confusion of voices—&quot;Hold up his head—Brandy
                                            now—Don't choke him—How was
                                            it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
                                            last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (&quot;That's Bill,&quot;
                                            thought Alice,) &quot;Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I'm better
                                            now—but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes
                                            at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So
                                            you did, old fellow!&quot; said the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We
                                            must burn the house down!&quot; said the Rabbit's voice. And Alice called
                                            out as loud as she could, &quot;If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There
                                            was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself &quot;I wonder
                                            what they will do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off.&quot;
                                            After a minute or two they began moving about again, and Alice heard the
                                            Rabbit say &quot;A barrowful will do, to begin with.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A
                                            barrowful of what?&quot; thought Alice. But she had not long to doubt, for
                                            the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window,
                                            and some of them hit her in the face. &quot;I'll put a stop to this,&quot;
                                            she said to herself, and shouted out &quot;You'd better not do that again!&quot;
                                            which produced another dead silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little
                                            cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. &quot;If
                                            I eat one of these cakes,&quot; she thought, &quot;it's sure to make some
                                            change in my size; and, as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me
                                            smaller, I suppose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she swallowed one of the
                                            cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon
                                            as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house,
                                            and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The
                                            poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two
                                            guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a
                                            rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could,
                                            and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The
                                            first thing I've got to do,&quot; said Alice to herself, as she wandered
                                            about in the wood, &quot;is to grow to my right size again; and the second
                                            thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the
                                            best plan.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounded an excellent plan,
                                            no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that
                                            she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and, while she was
                                            peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her
                                            head made her look up in a great hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An
                                            enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly
                                            stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. &quot;Poor little thing!&quot;
                                            said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she
                                            was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry,
                                            in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her
                                            coaxing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardly knowing what she did, she
                                            picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the
                                            puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
                                            and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged
                                            behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and, the moment
                                            she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick,
                                            and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice,
                                            thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and
                                            expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
                                            again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running
                                            a little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
                                            all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its
                                            tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
                                            seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at
                                            once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the
                                            puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            yet what a dear little puppy it was!&quot; said Alice, as she leant against
                                            a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves.
                                            &quot;I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I'd only been
                                            the right size to do it! Oh, dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to
                                            grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat
                                            or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            great
                                            question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and
                                            the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that looked like the
                                            right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large
                                            mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and, when she
                                            had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to
                                            her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She
                                            stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom,
                                            and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was
                                            sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and
                                            taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                    Alice's, and they walked off together. Alice was very glad to find her in such a
                                    pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
                                    made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.

                                            affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.&lt;br/&gt;Alice
                                            was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself
                                            that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they

                                            she said to herself (not in a very hopeful tone though), &quot;I won't have
                                            any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without—Maybe it's
                                            always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,&quot; she went on, very much
                                            pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, &quot;and vinegar that makes
                                            them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—barley-sugar and such
                                            things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then
                                            they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She
                                            had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when
                                            she heard her voice close to her ear. &quot;You're thinking about something,
                                            my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what
                                            the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps
                                            it hasn't one,&quot; Alice ventured to remark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tut,
                                            tut, child!&quot; said the Duchess. &quot;Every thing's got a moral, if only
                                            you can find it.&quot; And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as
                                            she spoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice did not much like her keeping
                                            so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly,
                                            because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin on Alice's
                                            shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like
                                            to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. &quot;The game's going on
                                            rather better now,&quot; she said, by way of keeping up the conversation a
                                            little.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;'Tis so,&quot; said the Duchess:
                                            &quot;and the moral of that is—'Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the
                                            world go round!'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Somebody said,&quot;
                                            Alice whispered, &quot;that it's done by everybody minding their own
                                            business!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, well! It means much
                                            the same thing,&quot; said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin into
                                            Alice's shoulder as she added, &quot;and the moral of that is—'Take care of
                                            the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How
                                            fond she is of finding morals in things!&quot; Alice thought to herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,&quot; the
                                            Duchess said after a pause: &quot;the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the
                                            temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He
                                            might bite,&quot; Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
                                            have the experiment tried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very true,&quot;
                                            said the Duchess: &quot;flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of
                                            that is—'Birds of a feather flock together.'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Only
                                            mustard isn't a bird,&quot; Alice remarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right,
                                            as usual,&quot; said the Duchess: &quot;what a clear way you have of putting
                                            things!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a mineral, I think,&quot;
                                            said Alice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course it is,&quot; said the Duchess,
                                            who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said: &quot;there's a
                                            large mustard-mine near here. And the moral of that is—'The more there is of
                                            mine, the less there is of yours.'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            I know!&quot; exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark.
                                            &quot;It's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            quite agree with you,&quot; said the Duchess; &quot;and the moral of that
                                            is—'Be what you would seem to be'—or if you'd like it put more simply—'Never
                                            imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others
                                            that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had
                                            been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            think I should understand that better,&quot; Alice said very politely,
                                            &quot;if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's
                                            nothing to what I could say if I chose,&quot; the Duchess replied, in a
                                            pleased tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pray don't trouble yourself
                                            to say it any longer than that,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            don't talk about trouble!&quot; said the Duchess. &quot;I make you a present
                                            of everything I've
                                            said as yet.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A cheap sort of
                                            present!&quot; thought Alice. &quot;I'm glad they don't give birthday
                                            presents like that!&quot; But she did not venture to say it out loud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thinking
                                            again?&quot; the Duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've
                                            a right to think,&quot; said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a
                                            little worried.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just about as much right,&quot;
                                            said the Duchess, &quot;as pigs have to fly; and the m——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But
                                            here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the
                                            middle of her favourite word &quot;moral,&quot; and the arm that was linked
                                            into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in
                                            front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A
                                            fine day, your Majesty!&quot; the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now,
                                            I give you fair warning,&quot; shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as
                                            she spoke; &quot;either you or your head must be off, and that in about half
                                            no time! Take your choice!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duchess
                                            took her choice, and was gone in a moment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let's
                                            go on with the game,&quot; the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much
                                            frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
                                            croquet-ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other guests had taken
                                            advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however,
                                            the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely
                                            remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All
                                            the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the
                                            other players, and shouting &quot;Off with his head!&quot; or &quot;Off with
                                            her head!&quot; Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
                                            soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
                                            the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
                                            players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under
                                            sentence of execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the Queen left off,
                                            quite out of breath, and said to Alice, &quot;Have you seen the Mock Turtle
                                            yet?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; said Alice. &quot;I
                                            don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's
                                            the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,&quot; said the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            never saw one, or heard of one,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come
                                            on then,&quot; said the Queen, &quot;and he shall tell you his history.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
                                            they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the
                                            company generally, &quot;You are all pardoned.&quot; &quot;Come, that's a
                                            good thing!&quot; she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
                                            number of executions the Queen had ordered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They
                                            very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don't
                                            know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) &quot;Up, lazy thing!&quot;
                                            said the Queen, &quot;and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and
                                            to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have
                                            ordered,&quot; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.
                                            Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she
                                            thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
                                            Queen: so she waited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gryphon sat up and
                                            rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then
                                            it chuckled. &quot;What fun!&quot; said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to
                                            Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is the fun?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why,
                                            she,&quot; said the Gryphon. &quot;It's all her fancy, that: they never
                                            executes nobody, you know. Come on!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everybody
                                            says 'come on!' here,&quot; thought Alice, as she went slowly after it:
                                            &quot;I never was so ordered about in my life, never!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They
                                            had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting
                                            sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice
                                            could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply.
                                            &quot;What is his sorrow?&quot; she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon
                                            answered, very nearly in the same words as before, &quot;It's all his fancy,
                                            that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know. Come on!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So
                                            they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of
                                            tears, but said nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This here
                                            young lady,&quot; said the Gryphon, &quot;she wants to know your history,
                                            she do.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll tell it her,&quot;
                                            said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone; &quot;sit down, both of you,
                                            and don't speak a word till I've finished.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So
                                            they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself,
                                            &quot;I don't see how he can ever finish, if he doesn't begin.&quot; But she
                                            waited patiently.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once,&quot; said the
                                            Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, &quot;I was a real Turtle.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These
                                            words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional
                                            exclamation of &quot;Hjckrrh!&quot; from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy
                                            sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying
                                            &quot;Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,&quot; but she could not
                                            help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When
                                            we were little,&quot; the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though
                                            still sobbing a little now and then, &quot;we went to school in the sea. The
                                            master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why
                                            did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?&quot; Alice asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We
                                            called him Tortoise because he taught us,&quot; said the Mock Turtle
                                            angrily: &quot;really you are very dull!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,&quot;
                                            added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice,
                                            who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock
                                            Turtle, &quot;Drive on, old fellow. Don't be all day about it!&quot; and he
                                            went on in these words:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, we went to
                                            school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            never said I didn't!&quot; interrupted Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            did,&quot; said the Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hold
                                            your tongue!&quot; added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The
                                            Mock Turtle went on:—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We had the best of
                                            educations—in fact, we went to school every day——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've
                                            been to a day-school, too,&quot; said Alice; &quot;you needn't be so proud
                                            as all that.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With extras?&quot;
                                            asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot;
                                            said Alice, &quot;we learned French and music.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            washing?&quot; said the Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Certainly
                                            not!&quot; said Alice indignantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah! then yours
                                            wasn't a really good school,&quot; said the Mock Turtle in a tone of relief.
                                            &quot;Now at ours they had at the end of the bill, 'French, music, and
                                            washing—extra.'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You couldn't have
                                            wanted it much,&quot; said Alice; &quot;living at the bottom of the sea.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            couldn't afford to learn it,&quot; said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. &quot;I
                                            only took the regular course.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            was that?&quot; inquired Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reeling
                                            and Writhing, of course, to begin with,&quot; the Mock Turtle replied;
                                            &quot;and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction,
                                            Uglification, and Derision.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never
                                            heard of 'Uglification,'&quot; Alice ventured to say. &quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. &quot;Never heard of uglifying!&quot;
                                            it exclaimed. &quot;You know what to beautify is, I suppose?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot;
                                            said Alice doubtfully: &quot;it means—to—make—anything—prettier.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            then,&quot; the Gryphon went on, &quot;if you don't know what to uglify is,
                                            you are a simpleton.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice did not feel
                                            encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turned to the Mock
                                            Turtle and said, &quot;What else had you to learn?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            there was Mystery,&quot; the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects
                                            on his flappers, &quot;—Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then
                                            Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a
                                            week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            was that like?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I
                                            can't show it you myself,&quot; the Mock Turtle said: &quot;I'm too stiff.
                                            And the Gryphon never
                                            learnt it.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hadn't time,&quot; said
                                            the Gryphon: &quot;I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old
                                            crab, he was.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never went to him,&quot;
                                            the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: &quot;he taught Laughing and Grief, they
                                            used to say.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So he did, so he did,&quot;
                                            said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in
                                            their paws.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And how many hours a day did
                                            you do lessons?&quot; said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ten
                                            hours the first day,&quot; said the Mock Turtle: &quot;nine the next, and so
                                            on.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a curious plan!&quot;
                                            exclaimed Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's the reason
                                            they're called lessons,&quot; the Gryphon remarked: &quot;because they
                                            lessen from day to day.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was quite a
                                            new idea to Alice, and she thought over it a little before she made her next
                                            remark. &quot;Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            course it was,&quot; said the Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            how did you manage on the twelfth?&quot; Alice went on eagerly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's
                                            enough about lessons,&quot; the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone:
                                            &quot;tell her something about the games now.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
                                            &lt;/p&gt;</text>

                                            for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
                                            mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Who are
                                            you?&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not
                                            an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly,
                                            &quot;I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I
                                            got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times
                                            since then.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean by
                                            that?&quot; said the Caterpillar sternly. &quot;Explain yourself!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            can't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir,&quot; said Alice, &quot;because I'm
                                            not myself, you see.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't see,&quot;
                                            said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm afraid I can't
                                            put it more clearly,&quot; Alice replied very politely, &quot;for I can't
                                            understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a
                                            day is very confusing.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It isn't,&quot;
                                            said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, perhaps you
                                            haven't found it so yet,&quot; said Alice, &quot;but when you have to turn
                                            into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a
                                            butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            a bit,&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            perhaps your feelings may be different,&quot; said Alice; &quot;all I know
                                            is, it would feel very queer to me.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You!&quot;
                                            said the Caterpillar contemptuously. &quot;Who are you?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which
                                            brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a
                                            little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such very short remarks, and
                                            she drew herself up and said, very gravely, &quot;I think you ought to tell
                                            me who you are, first.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why?&quot;
                                            said the Caterpillar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here was another puzzling question;
                                            and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar
                                            seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come
                                            back!&quot; the Caterpillar called after her. &quot;I've something important
                                            to say!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounded promising,
                                            certainly: Alice turned and came back again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Keep
                                            your temper,&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is
                                            that all?&quot; said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot;
                                            said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice thought she might
                                            as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might
                                            tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without
                                            speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
                                            again, and said, &quot;So you think you're changed, do you?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm
                                            afraid I am, sir,&quot; said Alice; &quot;I can't remember things as I
                                            used—and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can't
                                            remember what things?&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            I've tried to say 'How doth the little busy bee,' but it all came different!&quot;
                                            Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Repeat
                                            'You are old, Father William,'&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            folded her hands, and began:—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are old, Father
                                            William,&quot; the young man said,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;And your hair has become
                                            very white;&lt;br/&gt;And yet you incessantly stand on your head—&lt;br/&gt;Do
                                            you think, at your age, it is right?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In
                                            my youth,&quot; Father William replied to his son,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I feared
                                            it might injure the brain;&lt;br/&gt;But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have
                                            none,&lt;br/&gt;Why, I do it again and again.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I mentioned before,&lt;br/&gt;And
                                            have grown most uncommonly fat;&lt;br/&gt;Yet you turned a back-somersault
                                            in at the door—&lt;br/&gt;Pray, what is the reason of that?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In
                                            my youth,&quot; said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I
                                            kept all my limbs very supple&lt;br/&gt;By the use of this ointment—one
                                            shilling the box—&lt;br/&gt;Allow me to sell you a couple?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;and your jaws are too weak&lt;br/&gt;For
                                            anything tougher than suet;&lt;br/&gt;Yet you finished the goose, with
                                            the bones and the beak—&lt;br/&gt;Pray, how did you manage to do it?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In
                                            my youth,&quot; said his father, &quot;I took to the law&lt;br/&gt;And
                                            argued each case with my wife;&lt;br/&gt;And the muscular strength, which it
                                            gave to my jaw,&lt;br/&gt;Has lasted the rest of my life.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            are old,&quot; said the youth, &quot;one would hardly suppose&lt;br/&gt;That
                                            your eye was as steady as ever;&lt;br/&gt;Yet you balanced an eel on the end
                                            of your nose—&lt;br/&gt;What made you so awfully clever?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            have answered three questions, and that is enough,&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Said his
                                            father; &quot;don't give yourself airs!&lt;br/&gt;Do you think I can listen
                                            all day to such stuff?&lt;br/&gt;Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That
                                            is not said right,&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            quite right, I'm afraid,&quot; said Alice, timidly; &quot;some of the words
                                            have got altered.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is wrong from
                                            beginning to end,&quot; said the Caterpillar, decidedly, and there was
                                            silence for some minutes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Caterpillar was
                                            the first to speak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What size do you want
                                            to be?&quot; it asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I'm not
                                            particular as to size,&quot; Alice hastily replied; &quot;only one doesn't
                                            like changing so often, you know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            don't know,&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in all her life
                                            before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are
                                            you content now?&quot; said the Caterpillar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,&quot; said
                                            Alice: &quot;three inches is such a wretched height to be.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            is a very good height indeed!&quot; said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing
                                            itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            I'm not used to it!&quot; pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she
                                            thought to herself, &quot;I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily
                                            offended!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You'll get used to it in
                                            time,&quot; said the Caterpillar; and it put its hookah into its mouth and
                                            began smoking again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time Alice waited
                                            patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar
                                            took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.
                                            Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away into the grass, merely
                                            remarking as it went, &quot;One side will make you grow taller, and the
                                            other side will make you grow shorter.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One
                                            side of what? The other side of what?&quot; thought Alice to herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            the mushroom,&quot; said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud;
                                            and in another moment it was out of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make
                                            out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found
                                            this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms
                                            round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each
                                            hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And now which is which?&quot; she
                                            said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the
                                            effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had
                                            struck her foot!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was a good deal frightened by this
                                            very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she
                                            was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other
                                            bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly
                                            room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a
                                            morsel of the left-hand bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;Come, my head's free
                                            at last!&quot; said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in
                                            another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:
                                            all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck,
                                            which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far
                                            below her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What can all that green stuff
                                            be?&quot; said Alice. &quot;And where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my
                                            poor hands, how is it I ca'n't see you?&quot; She was moving them about as
                                            she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
                                            distant green leaves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As there seemed to be no
                                            chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to
                                            get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would
                                            bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded
                                            in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among
                                            the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under
                                            which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
                                            hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently
                                            with its wings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Serpent!&quot; screamed
                                            the Pigeon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm not a serpent!&quot; said
                                            Alice indignantly. &quot;Let me alone!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Serpent,
                                            I say again!&quot; repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and
                                            added with a kind of a sob, &quot;I've tried every way, and nothing seems to
                                            suit them!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven't the least idea
                                            what you're talking about,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've
                                            tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,&quot;
                                            the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; &quot;but those serpents!
                                            There's no pleasing them!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice was more
                                            and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more
                                            till the Pigeon had finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As if it
                                            wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,&quot; said the Pigeon; &quot;but I
                                            must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven't had a
                                            wink of sleep these three weeks!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm
                                            very sorry you've been annoyed,&quot; said Alice, who was beginning to see
                                            its meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And just as I'd taken the highest tree
                                            in the wood,&quot; continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek,
                                            &quot;and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must
                                            needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            I'm not a serpent, I tell you!&quot; said Alice. &quot;I'm a—— I'm a ——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well!
                                            What are you?&quot; said the Pigeon. &quot;I can see you're trying to invent
                                            something!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I—I'm a little girl,&quot;
                                            said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she
                                            had gone through that day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A likely story
                                            indeed!&quot; said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. &quot;I've
                                            seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as
                                            that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose
                                            you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            have tasted eggs, certainly,&quot; said Alice, who was a very truthful
                                            child; &quot;but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
                                            know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't believe it,&quot;
                                            said the Pigeon; &quot;but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent,
                                            that's all I can say.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was such a new
                                            idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the
                                            Pigeon the opportunity of adding, &quot;You're looking for eggs, I know that
                                            well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
                                            serpent?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It matters a good deal to
                                            me,&quot; said Alice hastily; &quot;but I'm not looking for eggs, as it
                                            happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want yours: I don't like them raw.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            be off, then!&quot; said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down
                                            again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she
                                            could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now
                                            and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that
                                            she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very
                                            carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing
                                            sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing
                                            herself down to her usual height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so long since she
                                            had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first;
                                            but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as
                                            usual. &quot;Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these
                                            changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to
                                            another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get
                                            into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?&quot; As she
                                            said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it
                                            about four feet high. &quot;Whoever lives there,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;it'll
                                            never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of
                                            their wits!&quot; So she began nibbling at the right-hand bit again, and did
                                            not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine
                                            inches high. &lt;/p&gt;</text>

        <chapterDescription __type="string">For a minute or two she stood looking at the house,
                                    and wondering what to do
                                    next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered
                                    him to be a
                                    footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;FOR a minute or two she stood looking at the
                                            house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
                                            running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was
                                            in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
                                            fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
                                            another footman in livery, with a round face and large eyes like a frog; and
                                            both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their
                                            heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a
                                            little way out of the wood to listen.&lt;br/&gt;The Fish-Footman began by
                                            producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and
                                            this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, &quot;For the
                                            Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.&quot; The
                                            Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of
                                            the words a little, &quot;From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to
                                            play croquet.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they both bowed low,
                                            and their curls got entangled together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of
                                            their hearing her; and, when she next peeped out, the Fish-Footman was gone,
                                            and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up
                                            into the sky.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice went timidly up to the door
                                            and knocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's no use in knocking,&quot;
                                            said the Footman, &quot;and that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the
                                            same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a
                                            noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.&quot; And certainly there was
                                            a most extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing,
                                            and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken
                                            to pieces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please, then,&quot; said
                                            Alice, &quot;how am I to get in?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There
                                            might be some sense in your knocking,&quot; the Footman went on without
                                            attending to her, &quot;if we had the door between us. For instance, if you
                                            were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.&quot; He
                                            was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice
                                            thought decidedly uncivil. &quot;But perhaps he can't help it,&quot; she
                                            said to herself: &quot;his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head.
                                            But at any rate he might answer questions. How am I to get in?&quot; she
                                            repeated aloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I shall sit here,&quot;
                                            the Footman remarked, &quot;till to-morrow——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
                                            this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming
                                            out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to
                                            pieces against one of the trees behind him.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;——or
                                            next day, maybe,&quot; the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if
                                            nothing had happened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How am I to get in?&quot;
                                            asked Alice again in a louder tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you to get
                                            in at all?&quot; said the Footman. &quot;That's the first question, you
                                            know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Footman and Alice&lt;br/&gt;It
                                            was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. &quot;It's really
                                            dreadful,&quot; she muttered to herself, &quot;the way all the creatures
                                            argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Footman seemed to consider this a good opportunity for repeating his remark,
                                            with variations. &quot;I shall sit here,&quot; he said, &quot;on and off,
                                            for days and days.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But what am I to
                                            do?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anything you like,&quot;
                                            said the Footman, and began whistling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            there's no use in talking to him,&quot; said Alice desperately: &quot;he's
                                            perfectly idiotic!&quot; And she opened the door and went in.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to
                                            the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle,
                                            nursing a baby, the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large
                                            cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's
                                            certainly too much pepper in that soup!&quot; Alice said to herself, as well
                                            as she could for sneezing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was certainly
                                            too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and the
                                            baby was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The only
                                            things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat
                                            which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please
                                            would you tell me,&quot; said Alice a little timidly, for she was not quite
                                            sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, &quot;why your cat
                                            grins like that?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a Cheshire
                                            cat,&quot; said the Duchess, &quot;and that's why. Pig!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She
                                            said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but
                                            she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her,
                                            so she took courage, and went on again:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that
                                            cats could grin.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They all can,&quot;
                                            said the Duchess; &quot;and most of 'em do.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            don't know of any that do,&quot; Alice said very politely, feeling quite
                                            pleased to have got into a conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            don't know much,&quot; said the Duchess; &quot;and that's a fact.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well
                                            to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix
                                            on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to
                                            work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the
                                            fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and
                                            dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the
                                            baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say
                                            whether the blows hurt it or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            please mind what you're doing!&quot; cried Alice, jumping up and down in an
                                            agony of terror. &quot;Oh, there goes his precious nose&quot;; as an
                                            unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;If
                                            everybody minded their own business,&quot; the Duchess said in a hoarse
                                            growl, &quot;the world would go round a deal faster than it does.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Which
                                            would not be an advantage,&quot; said Alice, who felt very glad to get an
                                            opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. &quot;Just think what
                                            work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes
                                            twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Talking
                                            of axes,&quot; said the Duchess, &quot;chop off her head.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint;
                                            but the cook was busily engaged in stirring the soup, and did not seem to be
                                            listening, so she ventured to go on again: &quot;Twenty-four hours, I think;
                                            or is it twelve? I——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, don't
                                            bother me,&quot; said the Duchess; &quot;I never could abide figures!&quot;
                                            And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby
                                            to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Speak
                                            roughly to your little boy,&lt;br/&gt;And beat him when he sneezes:&lt;br/&gt;He
                                            only does it to annoy,&lt;br/&gt;Because he knows it teases.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chorus&lt;br/&gt;(In
                                            which the cook and the baby joined):&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Wow! wow! wow!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;While
                                            the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby
                                            violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could
                                            hardly hear the words:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I speak severely
                                            to my boy,&lt;br/&gt;I beat him when he sneezes;&lt;br/&gt;For he can
                                            thoroughly enjoy&lt;br/&gt;The pepper when he pleases!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chorus.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Wow!
                                            wow! wow!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Here! you may nurse it a bit if you like!&quot;
                                            the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. &quot;I
                                            must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,&quot; and she hurried
                                            out of the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but
                                            it just missed her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice caught the baby with
                                            some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its
                                            arms and legs in all directions, &quot;just like a star-fish,&quot; thought
                                            Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she
                                            caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,
                                            so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could
                                            do to hold it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as she had made out the
                                            proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a knot, and then
                                            keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing
                                            itself,) she carried it out into the open air. &quot;If I don't take this
                                            child away with me,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;they're sure to kill it in a
                                            day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?&quot; She said
                                            the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left
                                            off sneezing by this time). &quot;Don't grunt,&quot; said Alice; &quot;that's
                                            not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see
                                            what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a very
                                            turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were
                                            getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look
                                            of the thing at all. &quot;But perhaps it was only sobbing,&quot; she
                                            thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No,
                                            there were no tears. &quot;If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,&quot;
                                            said Alice, seriously, &quot;I'll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
                                            now!&quot; The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible
                                            to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            was just beginning to think to herself, &quot;Now, what am I to do with this
                                            creature when I get it home?&quot; when it grunted again, so violently, that
                                            she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no
                                            mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that
                                            it would be quite absurd for her to carry it any further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So
                                            she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot
                                            quietly away into the wood. &quot;If it had grown up,&quot; she said to
                                            herself, &quot;it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
                                            rather a handsome pig, I think.&quot; And she began thinking over other
                                            children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to
                                            herself, &quot;if one only knew the right way to change them——&quot; when
                                            she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a
                                            tree a few yards off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cat only grinned when it saw
                                            Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and
                                            a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheshire
                                            cat in a tree&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Cheshire Puss,&quot; she began, rather
                                            timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however,
                                            it only grinned a little wider. &quot;Come, it's pleased so far,&quot;
                                            thought Alice, and she went on. &quot;Would you tell me, please, which way I
                                            ought to go from here?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That depends
                                            a good deal on where you want to get to,&quot; said the Cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            don't much care where——&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            it doesn't matter which way you go,&quot; said the Cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;——
                                            so long as I get somewhere,&quot; Alice added as an explanation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            you're sure to do that,&quot; said the Cat, &quot;if you only walk long
                                            enough.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice felt that this could not be
                                            denied, so she tried another question. &quot;What sort of people live about
                                            here?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In that direction,&quot; the
                                            Cat said, waving its right paw round, &quot;lives a Hatter: and in that
                                            direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives a March Hare. Visit
                                            either you like: they're both mad.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            I don't want to go among mad people,&quot; Alice remarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            you ca'n't help that,&quot; said the Cat: &quot;we're all mad here. I'm mad.
                                            You're mad.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do you know I'm
                                            mad?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You must be,&quot;
                                            said the Cat, &quot;or you wouldn't have come here.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on. &quot;And how do
                                            you know that you're mad?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;To begin
                                            with,&quot; said the Cat, &quot;a dog's not mad. You grant that?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            suppose so,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, then,&quot;
                                            the Cat went on, &quot;you see a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its
                                            tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when
                                            I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            call it purring, not growling,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Call
                                            it what you like,&quot; said the Cat. &quot;Do you play croquet with the
                                            Queen to-day?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I should like it very
                                            much,&quot; said Alice, &quot;but I haven't been invited yet.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You'll
                                            see me there,&quot; said the Cat and vanished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
                                            things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it
                                            suddenly appeared again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By-the-bye, what became of
                                            the baby?&quot; said the Cat. &quot;I'd nearly forgotten to ask.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            turned into a pig,&quot; Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in
                                            a natural way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought it would,&quot;
                                            said the Cat, and vanished again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice waited
                                            a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a
                                            minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was
                                            said to live. &quot;I've seen hatters before,&quot; she said to herself;
                                            &quot;the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this
                                            is May, it won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March.&quot;
                                            As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on the
                                            branch of a tree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did you say pig, or
                                            fig?&quot; said the Cat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said pig,&quot;
                                            replied Alice; &quot;and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so
                                            suddenly: you make one quite giddy.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All
                                            right,&quot; said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning
                                            with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time
                                            after the rest of it had gone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well! I've
                                            often seen a cat without a grin,&quot; thought Alice; &quot;but a grin
                                            without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She
                                            had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March
                                            Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were
                                            shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a
                                            house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of
                                            the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself, to about two feet high:
                                            even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself, &quot;Suppose
                                            it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter
                                            instead!&quot; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;T HERE was a table set out under a tree in front
                                            of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a
                                            Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using
                                            it as a cushion resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
                                            &quot;Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,&quot; thought Alice; &quot;only
                                            as it's asleep, suppose it doesn't mind.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;The table was a
                                            large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it.
                                            &quot;No room! No room!&quot; they cried out when they saw Alice coming.
                                            &quot;There's plenty of room!&quot; said Alice indignantly, and she sat down
                                            in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have
                                            some wine,&quot; the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. &quot;I
                                            don't see any wine,&quot; she remarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There
                                            isn't any,&quot; said the March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,&quot; said Alice angrily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,&quot; said the
                                            March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn't know it was your
                                            table,&quot; said Alice; &quot;it's laid for a great many more than three.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your
                                            hair wants cutting,&quot; said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for
                                            some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            should learn not to make personal remarks,&quot; Alice said with some
                                            severity; &quot;it's very rude.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said was &quot;Why
                                            is a raven like a writing-desk?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come,
                                            we shall have some fun now!&quot; thought Alice. &quot;I'm glad they've
                                            begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,&quot; she added aloud.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do
                                            you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?&quot; said the
                                            March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exactly so,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            you should say what you mean,&quot; the March Hare went on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            do,&quot; Alice hastily replied; &quot;at least—at least I mean what I
                                            say—that's the same thing, you know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            the same thing a bit!&quot; said the Hatter. &quot;Why, you might just as
                                            well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            might just as well say,&quot; added the March Hare, &quot;that 'I like what
                                            I get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            might just as well say,&quot; added the Dormouse, which seemed to be talking
                                            in his sleep, &quot;that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing as 'I
                                            sleep when I breathe'!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is the
                                            same thing with you,&quot; said the Hatter; and here the conversation
                                            dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all
                                            she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Hatter was the first to break the silence. &quot;What day of the month is
                                            it?&quot; he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his
                                            pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and
                                            holding it to his ear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice considered a
                                            little, and then said &quot;The fourth.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two
                                            days wrong!&quot; sighed the Hatter. &quot;I told you butter would not suit
                                            the works!&quot; he added, looking angrily at the March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            was the best butter,&quot; the March Hare meekly replied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,
                                            but some crumbs must have got in as well,&quot; the Hatter grumbled: &quot;you
                                            shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into
                                            his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better
                                            to say than his first remark, &quot;It was the best butter, you know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. &quot;What a funny
                                            watch!&quot; she remarked. &quot;It tells the day of the month, and doesn't
                                            tell what o'clock it is!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why should
                                            it?&quot; muttered the Hatter. &quot;Does your watch tell you what year it
                                            is?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course not,&quot; Alice
                                            replied very readily: &quot;but that's because it stays the same year for
                                            such a long time together.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Which
                                            is just the case with mine,&quot; said the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no meaning in
                                            it, and yet it was certainly English. &quot;I don't quite understand,&quot;
                                            she said, as politely as she could.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The
                                            Dormouse is asleep again,&quot; said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot
                                            tea upon its nose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dormouse shook its head
                                            impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, &quot;Of course, of course;
                                            just what I was going to remark myself.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have
                                            you guessed the riddle yet?&quot; the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,
                                            I give it up,&quot; Alice replied: &quot;what's the answer?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            haven't the slightest idea,&quot; said the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nor
                                            I,&quot; said the March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice sighed
                                            wearily. &quot;I think you might do something better with the time,&quot;
                                            she said, &quot;than wasting it asking riddles with no answers.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If
                                            you knew Time as well as I do,&quot; said the Hatter, &quot;you wouldn't
                                            talk about wasting it. It's him.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            don't know what you mean,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            course you don't!&quot; the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
                                            &quot;I daresay you never spoke to Time!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps
                                            not,&quot; Alice cautiously replied: &quot;but I know I have to beat time
                                            when I learn music.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah! that
                                            accounts for it,&quot; said the Hatter. &quot;He won't stand beating. Now,
                                            if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything you liked
                                            with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning,
                                            just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and
                                            round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&quot;I
                                            only wish it was,&quot; the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That
                                            would be grand, certainly,&quot; said Alice thoughtfully: &quot;but then—I
                                            shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            at first, perhaps,&quot; said the Hatter: &quot;but you could keep it to
                                            half-past one as long as you liked.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is
                                            that the way you manage?&quot; Alice asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Hatter shook his head mournfully. &quot;Not I!&quot; he replied. &quot;We
                                            quarrelled last March——just before he went mad, you know——&quot; (pointing
                                            with his teaspoon to the March Hare), &quot;it was at the great concert
                                            given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Twinkle,
                                            twinkle, little bat!&lt;br/&gt;How I wonder what you're at!'&lt;br/&gt;You
                                            know that song, perhaps?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I've heard something like it,&quot;
                                            said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It goes on, you know,&quot;
                                            the Hatter continued, &quot;in this way:—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Up
                                            above the world you fly,&lt;br/&gt;Like a tea-tray in the sky.&lt;br/&gt;Twinkle,
                                            twinkle——'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began
                                            singing in its sleep &quot;Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle——&quot; and
                                            went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            I'd hardly finished the first verse,&quot; said the Hatter, &quot;when the
                                            Queen jumped up and bawled out 'He's murdering the time! Off with his head!'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How
                                            dreadfully savage!&quot; exclaimed Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            ever since that,&quot; the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, &quot;he won't
                                            do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A
                                            bright idea came into Alice's head. &quot;Is that the reason so many
                                            tea-things are put out here?&quot; she asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,
                                            that's it,&quot; said the Hatter with a sigh: &quot;it's always tea-time,
                                            and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            you keep moving round, I suppose?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exactly
                                            so,&quot; said the Hatter: &quot;as the things get used up.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            what happens when you come to the beginning again?&quot; Alice ventured to
                                            ask.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Suppose we change the subject,&quot;
                                            the March Hare interrupted, yawning. &quot;I'm getting tired of this. I vote
                                            the young lady tells us a story.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm
                                            afraid I don't know one,&quot; said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            the Dormouse shall!&quot; they both cried. &quot;Wake up, Dormouse!&quot;
                                            And they pinched it on both sides at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. &quot;I wasn't asleep,&quot; he said in a
                                            hoarse, feeble voice: &quot;I heard every word you fellows were saying.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tell
                                            us a story!&quot; said the March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,
                                            please do!&quot; pleaded Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And be
                                            quick about it,&quot; added the Hatter, &quot;or you'll be asleep again
                                            before it's done.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once upon a time
                                            there were three little sisters,&quot; the Dormouse began in a great hurry;
                                            &quot;and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the
                                            bottom of a well——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What did they
                                            live on?&quot; said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of
                                            eating and drinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They lived on
                                            treacle,&quot; said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They
                                            couldn't have done that, you know,&quot; Alice gently remarked; &quot;they'd
                                            have been ill.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So they were,&quot;
                                            said the Dormouse; &quot;very ill.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            tried a little to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living
                                            would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: &quot;But why
                                            did they live at the bottom of a well?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Take
                                            some more tea,&quot; the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I've
                                            had nothing yet,&quot; Alice replied in an offended tone, &quot;so I can't
                                            take more.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You mean you can't take
                                            less,&quot; said the Hatter; &quot;it's very easy to take more than nothing.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nobody
                                            asked your opinion,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who's
                                            making personal remarks now?&quot; the Hatter asked triumphantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea
                                            and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her
                                            question. &quot;Why did they live at the bottom of a well?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, &quot;It
                                            was a treacle-well.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's no such
                                            thing!&quot; Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March
                                            Hare went &quot;Sh! sh!&quot; and the Dormouse sulkily remarked: &quot;If
                                            you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,
                                            please go on!&quot; Alice said very humbly. &quot;I won't interrupt you
                                            again. I dare say there may be one.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One,
                                            indeed!&quot; said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on.
                                            &quot;And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw, you
                                            know——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What did they draw?&quot;
                                            said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Treacle,&quot;
                                            said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            want a clean cup,&quot; interrupted the Hatter: &quot;let's all move one
                                            place on.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He moved as he spoke, and the
                                            Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and
                                            Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was
                                            the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good
                                            deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug
                                            into his plate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice did not wish to offend
                                            the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: &quot;But I don't
                                            understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            can draw water out of a water-well,&quot; said the Hatter; &quot;so I should
                                            think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            they were in the well,&quot; Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to
                                            notice this last remark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course they
                                            were,&quot; said the Dormouse; &quot;——well in.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
                                            answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse go on for some time
                                            without interrupting it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were
                                            learning to draw,&quot; the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes,
                                            for it was getting very sleepy; &quot;and they drew all manner of
                                            things—everything that begins with an M——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why
                                            with an M?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why not?&quot;
                                            said the March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            was silent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time,
                                            and was going off into a dose; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke
                                            up again with a little shriek, and went on: &quot;—— that begins with an M,
                                            such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say
                                            things are 'much of a muchness'—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing
                                            of a muchness?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really, now you ask
                                            me,&quot; said Alice, very much confused, &quot;I don't think——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            you shouldn't talk,&quot; said the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
                                            piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great
                                            disgust and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of
                                            the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once
                                            or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw
                                            them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At
                                            any rate I'll never go there again!&quot; said Alice as she picked her way
                                            through the wood. &quot;It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my
                                            life!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as she said this, she noticed
                                            that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. &quot;That's very
                                            curious!&quot; she thought. &quot;But everything's curious to-day. I think I
                                            may as well go in at once.&quot; And in she went.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once
                                            more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass
                                            table. &quot;Now I'll manage better this time,&quot; she said to herself,
                                            and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led
                                            into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept
                                            a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked
                                            down the little passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful
                                            garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of the
                                            garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners
                                            at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing,
                                            and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
                                            one of them say &quot;Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me
                                            like that!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;I couldn't help it,&quot; said Five, in a
                                            sulky tone. &quot;Seven jogged my elbow.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On
                                            which Seven looked up and said, &quot;That's right, Five! Always lay the
                                            blame on others!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You'd better not
                                            talk!&quot; said Five. &quot;I heard the Queen say only yesterday you
                                            deserved to be beheaded!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What for?&quot;
                                            said the one who had first spoken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's
                                            none of your business, Two!&quot; said Seven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,
                                            it is his business!&quot; said Five. &quot;And I'll tell him—it was for
                                            bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven
                                            flung down his brush, and had just begun &quot;Well, of all the unjust
                                            things——&quot; when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood
                                            watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round
                                            also, and all of them bowed low.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would
                                            you tell me,&quot; said Alice, a little timidly, &quot;why you are painting
                                            those roses?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five and Seven said nothing,
                                            but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, &quot;Why, the fact is, you
                                            see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white
                                            one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have
                                            our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore
                                            she comes, to——&quot; At this moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking
                                            across the garden, called out &quot;The Queen! The Queen!&quot; and the
                                            three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was
                                            a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First
                                            came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three
                                            gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next
                                            the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked
                                            two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there
                                            were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in
                                            hand, in couples; they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the
                                            guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White
                                            Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried, nervous manner, smiling at everything
                                            that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of
                                            Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and last of
                                            all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the
                                            three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule
                                            at processions; &quot;and besides, what would be the use of a procession,&quot;
                                            thought she, &quot;if people had to lie down upon their faces, so that they
                                            couldn't see it?&quot; So she stood still where she was, and waited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When
                                            the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her,
                                            and the Queen said severely, &quot;Who is this?&quot; She said it to the
                                            Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Idiot!&quot;
                                            said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and turning to Alice, she went
                                            on, &quot;What's your name, child?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My
                                            name is Alice, so please your Majesty,&quot; said Alice very politely; but
                                            she added, to herself, &quot;Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all. I
                                            needn't be afraid of them!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And who
                                            are these?&quot; said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were
                                            lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces,
                                            and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she
                                            could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or
                                            three of her own children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How should I
                                            know?&quot; said Alice, surprised at her own courage. &quot;It's no business
                                            of mine.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queen turned crimson with
                                            fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed
                                            &quot;Off with her head! Off——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nonsense!&quot;
                                            said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said &quot;Consider
                                            my dear: she is only a child!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queen
                                            turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave &quot;Turn them over!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get
                                            up!&quot; said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners
                                            instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal
                                            children, and everybody else.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leave off
                                            that!&quot; screamed the Queen. &quot;You make me giddy.&quot; And then,
                                            turning to the rose-tree, she went on, &quot;What have you been doing here?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;May
                                            it please your Majesty,&quot; said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on
                                            one knee as he spoke, &quot;we were trying——&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            see!&quot; said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
                                            &quot;Off with their heads!&quot; and the procession moved on, three of the
                                            soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to
                                            Alice for protection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You shan't be
                                            beheaded!&quot; said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that
                                            stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking
                                            for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are
                                            their heads off?&quot; shouted the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Their
                                            heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!&quot; the soldiers shouted in
                                            reply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's right!&quot; shouted the
                                            Queen. &quot;Can you play croquet?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently
                                            meant for her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes!&quot; shouted Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come
                                            on, then!&quot; roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering
                                            very much what would happen next.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's—it's
                                            a very fine day!&quot; said a timid voice at her side. She was walking by
                                            the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very,&quot;
                                            said Alice: &quot;——where's the Duchess?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hush!
                                            Hush!&quot; said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone. He looked anxiously over
                                            his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth
                                            close to her ear, and whispered &quot;She's under sentence of execution.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            for?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did you say 'What
                                            a pity!'?&quot; the Rabbit asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, I
                                            didn't,&quot; said Alice: &quot;I don't think it's at all a pity. I said
                                            'What for?'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She boxed the Queen's
                                            ears—&quot; the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. &quot;Oh,
                                            hush!&quot; the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. &quot;The Queen will
                                            hear you! You see she came rather late, and the Queen said——&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get
                                            to your places!&quot; shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people
                                            began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other;
                                            however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alice
                                            thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life; it
                                            was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
                                            flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand upon
                                            their hands and feet, to make the arches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo; she
                                            succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her
                                            arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck
                                            nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its
                                            head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a
                                            puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when
                                            she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very
                                            provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act
                                            of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or a furrow
                                            in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the
                                            doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of
                                            the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult
                                            game indeed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The players all played at once
                                            without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the
                                            hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and
                                            went stamping about, and shouting &quot;Off with his head!&quot; or &quot;Off
                                            with her head!&quot; about once in a minute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            began to feel very uneasy: to be sure she had
                                            not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen
                                            any minute, &quot;and then,&quot; thought she, &quot;what would become of
                                            me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here: the great wonder is
                                            that there's any one left alive!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was
                                            looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get
                                            away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air:
                                            it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two,
                                            she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself &quot;It's the
                                            Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How
                                            are you getting on?&quot; said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough
                                            for it to speak with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice waited till the
                                            eyes appeared, and then nodded. &quot;It's no use speaking to it,&quot; she
                                            thought, &quot;till its ears have come, or at least one of them.&quot; In
                                            another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her
                                            flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had some
                                            one to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it
                                            now in sight, and no more of it appeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            don't think they play at all fairly,&quot; Alice began, in rather a
                                            complaining tone, &quot;and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear
                                            oneself speak—and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least,
                                            if there are, nobody attends to them—and you've no idea how confusing it is
                                            all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go
                                            through next walking about at the other end of the ground—and I should have
                                            croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine
                                            coming!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do you like the Queen?&quot; said
                                            the Cat in a low voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not at all,&quot;
                                            said Alice: &quot;she's so extremely——&quot; Just then she noticed that the
                                            Queen was close behind her listening: so she went on, &quot;——likely to win,
                                            that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Queen smiled and passed on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who are you
                                            talking to?&quot; said the King, coming up to Alice, and looking at the
                                            Cat's head with great curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a
                                            friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,&quot; said Alice: &quot;allow me to introduce
                                            it.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't like the look of it at
                                            all,&quot; said the King: &quot;however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd
                                            rather not,&quot; the Cat remarked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't
                                            be impertinent,&quot; said the King, &quot;and don't look at me like that!&quot;
                                            He got behind Alice as he spoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A cat
                                            may look at a king,&quot; said Alice. &quot;I've read that in some book, but
                                            I don't remember where.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, it
                                            must be removed,&quot; said the King very decidedly, and he called to the
                                            Queen, who was passing at the moment, &quot;My dear! I wish you would have
                                            this cat removed!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Queen had only one
                                            way of settling all difficulties, great or small. &quot;Off with his head!&quot;
                                            she said, without even looking round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'll
                                            fetch the executioner myself,&quot; said the King eagerly, and he hurried
                                            off.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice thought she might as well go back
                                            and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the
                                            distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three
                                            of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not
                                            like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she
                                            never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her
                                            hedgehog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hedgehog was engaged in a fight
                                            with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for
                                            croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her
                                            flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could
                                            see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into one of the trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By
                                            the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was
                                            over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: &quot;but it doesn't matter
                                            much,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;as all the arches are gone from this side
                                            of the ground.&quot; So she tucked it under her arm, that it might not
                                            escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When
                                            she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large
                                            crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the
                                            executioner, the King, and
                                            the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite
                                            silent, and looked very uncomfortable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the
                                            question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all
                                            spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they
                                            said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't
                                            cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never
                                            had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at his time of
                                            life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King's argument was, that anything
                                            that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no
                                            time, she'd have everybody executed all round. (It was this last remark that
                                            had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            could think of nothing else to say but &quot;It belongs to the Duchess:
                                            you'd better ask her about it.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She's
                                            in prison,&quot; the Queen said to the executioner; &quot;fetch her here.&quot;
                                            And the executioner went off like an arrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and by the time he had
                                            come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the
                                            executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the
                                            party went back to the game.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;THE Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back
                                            of one flapper across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but,
                                            for a minute or two, sobs choked his voice. &quot;Same as if he had a bone
                                            in his throat,&quot; said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and
                                            punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and,
                                            with tears running down his cheeks, went on again:&lt;br/&gt;&quot;You may
                                            not have lived much under the sea—&quot; (&quot;I haven't,&quot; said Alice)
                                            &quot;and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—&quot; (Alice
                                            began to say &quot;I once tasted——&quot; but checked herself hastily, and
                                            said &quot;No, never,) &quot;—so you can have no idea what a delightful
                                            thing a Lobster Quadrille is!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,
                                            indeed,&quot; said Alice. &quot;What sort of a dance is it?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why,&quot;
                                            said the Gryphon, &quot;you first form into a line along the sea-shore——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Two
                                            lines!&quot; cried the Mock Turtle. &quot;Seals, turtles, and so on; then,
                                            when you've cleared the jelly-fish out of the way——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That
                                            generally takes some time,&quot; interrupted the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;—you
                                            advance twice——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Each with a lobster
                                            as a partner!&quot; cried the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            course,&quot; the Mock Turtle said: &quot;advance twice, set to partners——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;—change
                                            lobsters, and retire in same order,&quot; continued the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then,
                                            you know,&quot; the Mock Turtle went on, &quot;you throw the——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The
                                            lobsters!&quot; shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;—as
                                            far out to sea as you can——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Swim,
                                            after them!&quot; screamed the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Turn
                                            a somersault in the sea!&quot; cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Change
                                            lobsters again!&quot; yelled the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Back
                                            to land again, and—that's all the first figure,&quot; said the Mock Turtle,
                                            suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping
                                            about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly,
                                            and looked at Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It must be a very
                                            pretty dance,&quot; said Alice, timidly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would
                                            you like to see a little of it?&quot; said the Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very
                                            much indeed,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come,
                                            let's try the first figure!&quot; said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.
                                            &quot;We can do it without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            you sing,&quot; said the Gryphon. &quot;I've forgotten the words.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So
                                            they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then
                                            treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws
                                            to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Will
                                            you walk a little faster?&quot; said a whiting to a snail,&lt;br/&gt;&quot;There's
                                            a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.&lt;br/&gt;See how
                                            eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!&lt;br/&gt;They are waiting
                                            on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?&lt;br/&gt;Will you, won't
                                            you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?&lt;br/&gt;Will you, won't
                                            you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            can really have no notion how delightful it will be,&lt;br/&gt;When they
                                            take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;But
                                            the snail replied: &quot;Too far, too far!&quot; and gave a look askance—&lt;br/&gt;Said
                                            he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.&lt;br/&gt;Would
                                            not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.&lt;br/&gt;Would
                                            not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            matters it how far we go?&quot; his scaly friend replied;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;There
                                            is another shore, you know, upon the other side.&lt;br/&gt;The further off
                                            from England the nearer is to France—&lt;br/&gt;Then turn not pale, beloved
                                            snail, but come and join the dance.&lt;br/&gt;Will you, won't you, will you,
                                            won't you, will you join the dance?&lt;br/&gt;Will you, won't you, will you,
                                            won't you, won't you join the dance?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Thank you, it's a
                                            very interesting dance to watch,&quot; said Alice, feeling very glad that it
                                            was over at last: &quot;and I do so like that curious song about the
                                            whiting!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, as to the whiting,&quot;
                                            said the Mock Turtle, &quot;they—you've seen them, of course?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot;
                                            said Alice, &quot;I've often seen them at dinn——&quot; she checked herself
                                            hastily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know where Dinn may be,&quot;
                                            said the Mock Turtle, &quot;but if you've seen them so often, of course you
                                            know what they're like.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe
                                            so,&quot; Alice replied thoughtfully. &quot;They have their tails in their
                                            mouths—and they're all over crumbs.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're
                                            wrong about the crumbs,&quot; said the Mock Turtle: &quot;crumbs would all
                                            wash off in the sea. But they have their tails in their mouths; and the
                                            reason is—&quot; here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes. &quot;Tell
                                            her about the reason and all that,&quot; he said to the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The
                                            reason is,&quot; said the Gryphon, &quot;that they would go with the
                                            lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a
                                            long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get
                                            them out again. That's all.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank
                                            you,&quot; said Alice. &quot;It's very interesting. I never knew so much
                                            about a whiting before.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can tell
                                            you more than that, if you like,&quot; said the Gryphon. &quot;Do you know
                                            why it's called a whiting?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never
                                            thought about it,&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            does the boots and shoes,&quot; the Gryphon replied very solemnly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            was thoroughly puzzled. &quot;Does the boots and shoes!&quot; she repeated
                                            in a wondering tone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why, what are your
                                            shoes done with?&quot; said the Gryphon. &quot;I mean, what makes them so
                                            shiny?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice looked down at them, and
                                            considered a little before she gave her answer. &quot;They're done with
                                            blacking, I believe.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Boots and
                                            shoes under the sea,&quot; the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, &quot;are
                                            done with whiting. Now you know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            what are they made of?&quot; Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Soles
                                            and eels, of course,&quot; the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: &quot;any
                                            shrimp could have told you that.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If
                                            I'd been the whiting,&quot; said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on
                                            the song, &quot;I'd have said to the porpoise, 'Keep back, please: we don't
                                            want you with us!'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They were
                                            obliged to have him with them,&quot; the Mock Turtle said: &quot;no wise
                                            fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wouldn't
                                            it really?&quot; said Alice in a tone of great surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            course not,&quot; said the Mock Turtle: &quot;why, if a fish came to me, and
                                            told me he was going a journey, I should say, 'With what porpoise?'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't
                                            you mean 'purpose'?&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            mean what I say,&quot; the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the
                                            Gryphon added, &quot;Come, let's hear some of your adventures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,&quot; said Alice a
                                            little timidly: &quot;but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was
                                            a different person then.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Explain
                                            all that,&quot; said the Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,
                                            no! The adventures first,&quot; said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:
                                            &quot;explanations take such a dreadful time.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So
                                            Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the
                                            White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two
                                            creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and
                                            mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners
                                            were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating &quot;You
                                            are old, Father William,&quot; to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming
                                            different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said, &quot;That's
                                            very curious.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's all about as
                                            curious as it can be,&quot; said the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            all came different!&quot; the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. &quot;I
                                            should like to hear her repeat something now. Tell her to begin.&quot; He
                                            looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over
                                            Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stand
                                            up and repeat ''Tis the voice of the sluggard,'&quot; said the Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;How
                                            the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!&quot; thought
                                            Alice. &quot;I might as well be at school at once.&quot; However, she got
                                            up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster
                                            Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very
                                            queer indeed:—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;'Tis the voice of the
                                            Lobster; I heard him declare,&lt;br/&gt;'You have baked me too brown, I must
                                            sugar my hair.'&lt;br/&gt;As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose&lt;br/&gt;Trims
                                            his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.&lt;br/&gt;When the sands
                                            are all dry, he is gay as a lark,&lt;br/&gt;And will talk in contemptuous
                                            tones of the Shark:&lt;br/&gt;But, when the tide rises and sharks are
                                            around,&lt;br/&gt;His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;That's
                                            different from what I used to say when I was a child,&quot; said the
                                            Gryphon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, I never heard it before,&quot;
                                            said the Mock Turtle: &quot;but it sounds uncommon nonsense.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice
                                            said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering if
                                            anything would ever happen in a natural way again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            should like to have it explained,&quot; said the Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She
                                            ca'n't explain it,&quot; hastily said the Gryphon. &quot;Go on with the next
                                            verse.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But about his toes?&quot;
                                            the Mock Turtle persisted. &quot;How could he turn them out with his nose,
                                            you know?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's the first position
                                            in dancing,&quot; Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing,
                                            and longed to change the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Go on
                                            with the next verse,&quot; the Gryphon repeated: &quot;it begins 'I passed
                                            by his garden.'&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice did not dare to
                                            disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a
                                            trembling voice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I passed by his garden, and marked,
                                            with one eye,&lt;br/&gt;How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie:&lt;br/&gt;The
                                            Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,&lt;br/&gt;While the Owl had the
                                            dish as its share of the treat.&lt;br/&gt;When the pie was all finished, the
                                            Owl, as a boon,&lt;br/&gt;Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:&lt;br/&gt;While
                                            the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,&lt;br/&gt;And concluded
                                            the banquet by——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Mock turtle&lt;br/&gt;&quot;What is the use
                                            of repeating all that stuff,&quot; the Mock Turtle interrupted, &quot;if you
                                            don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the most confusing thing I ever
                                            heard!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, I think you'd better
                                            leave off,&quot; said the Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shall
                                            we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?&quot; the Gryphon went on.
                                            &quot;Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you another song?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,&quot; Alice replied, so
                                            eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, &quot;H'm! No
                                            accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Turtle Soup,' will you, old fellow?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice choked with sobs, to sing
                                            this:—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,&lt;br/&gt;Waiting
                                            in a hot tureen!&lt;br/&gt;Who for such dainties would not stoop?&lt;br/&gt;Soup
                                            of the evening, beautiful Soup!&lt;br/&gt;Soup of the evening, beautiful
                                            Soup!&lt;br/&gt;Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!&lt;br/&gt;Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!&lt;br/&gt;Soo—oop
                                            of the e—e—evening,&lt;br/&gt;Beautiful, beautiful Soup!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beautiful
                                            Soup! Who cares for fish,&lt;br/&gt;Game, or any other dish?&lt;br/&gt;Who

                                            Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of
                                            &quot;The trial's beginning!&quot; was heard in the distance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come
                                            on!&quot; cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off,
                                            without waiting for the end of the song.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What
                                            trial is it?&quot; Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only answered
                                            &quot;Come on!&quot; and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came,
                                            carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Soo—oop
                                            of the e—e—evening,&lt;br/&gt;Beautiful, beautiful Soup!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
                                            &lt;/p&gt;</text>

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;THE King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their
                                            throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts
                                            of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave
                                            was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
                                            him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and
                                            a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a
                                            table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made
                                            Alice quite hungry to look at them—&quot;I wish they'd get the trial done,&quot;
                                            she thought, &quot;and hand round the refreshments!&quot; But there seemed
                                            to be no chance of this, so she began looking about her, to pass away the
                                            time.&lt;br/&gt;Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she
                                            had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she
                                            knew the name of nearly everything there. &quot;That's the judge,&quot; she
                                            said to herself, &quot;because of his great wig.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, he
                                            did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And
                                            that's the jury-box,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;and those twelve creatures,&quot;
                                            (she was obliged to say &quot;creatures,&quot; you see, because some of them
                                            were animals, and some were birds,) &quot;I suppose they are the jurors.&quot;
                                            She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
                                            proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of
                                            her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, &quot;jurymen&quot; would
                                            have done just as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twelve jurors were
                                            all writing very busily on slates. &quot;What are they all doing?&quot;
                                            Alice whispered to the Gryphon. &quot;They can't have anything to put down
                                            yet, before the trial's begun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They're putting
                                            down their names,&quot; the Gryphon whispered in reply, &quot;for fear they
                                            should forget them before the end of the trial.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stupid
                                            things!&quot; Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
                                            hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out &quot;Silence in the court!&quot;
                                            and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to see who
                                            was talking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice could see, as well as if she
                                            were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down
                                            &quot;stupid things!&quot; on their slates, and she could even make out that
                                            one of them didn't know how to spell &quot;stupid,&quot; and that he had to
                                            ask his neighbour to tell him. &quot;A nice muddle their slates will be in
                                            before the trial's over!&quot; thought Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One
                                            of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This, of course, Alice could not
                                            stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found
                                            an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little
                                            juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of
                                            it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one
                                            finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left
                                            no mark on the slate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herald, read the
                                            accusation!&quot; said the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this the
                                            White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the
                                            parchment scroll, and read as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The
                                            Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,&lt;br/&gt;All on a summer day:&lt;br/&gt;The
                                            Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,&lt;br/&gt;And took them quite away!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Consider
                                            your verdict,&quot; the King said to the jury.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not
                                            yet, not yet!&quot; the Rabbit hastily interrupted. &quot;There's a great
                                            deal to come before that!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Call the
                                            first witness,&quot; said the King; and the Rabbit blew three blasts on the
                                            trumpet, and called out &quot;First witness!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a
                                            piece of bread-and-butter in the other. &quot;I beg pardon, your Majesty,&quot;
                                            he began, &quot;for bringing these in; but I hadn't quite finished my tea
                                            when I was sent for.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You ought to
                                            have finished,&quot; said the King. &quot;When did you begin?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court,
                                            arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. &quot;Fourteenth of March, I think it was,&quot;
                                            he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fifteenth,&quot; said the March
                                            Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sixteenth,&quot; said the Dormouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Write
                                            that down,&quot;
                                            the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates
                                            on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings
                                            and pence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Take off your hat,&quot; the
                                            King said to the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It isn't mine,&quot;
                                            said the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stolen!&quot; the King
                                            exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            keep them to sell,&quot; the Hatter added as an explanation: &quot;I've none
                                            of my own. I'm a hatter.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the Queen
                                            put on her spectacles, and began staring hard at the Hatter, who turned pale
                                            and fidgeted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Give your evidence,&quot;
                                            said the King; &quot;and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the
                                            spot.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not seem to encourage the
                                            witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking
                                            uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
                                            teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just at this
                                            moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal
                                            until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and
                                            she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second
                                            thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
                                            her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wish you wouldn't squeeze so,&quot;
                                            said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. &quot;I can hardly breathe.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            can't help it,&quot; said Alice very meekly: &quot;I'm growing.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You've
                                            no right to grow here,&quot; said the Dormouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don't
                                            talk nonsense,&quot; said Alice more boldly: &quot;you know you're growing
                                            too.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, but I grow at a
                                            reasonable pace,&quot; said the Dormouse; &quot;not in that ridiculous
                                            fashion.&quot; And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side
                                            of the court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this time the Queen had never
                                            left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court,
                                            she said to one of the officers of the court, &quot;Bring me the list of the
                                            singers in the last concert!&quot; on which the wretched Hatter trembled so,
                                            that he shook off both his shoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Give
                                            your evidence,&quot; the King repeated angrily, &quot;or I'll have you
                                            executed, whether you're nervous or not.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm
                                            a poor man, your Majesty,&quot; the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,
                                            &quot;—and I hadn't begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the
                                            bread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The
                                            twinkling of what?&quot; said the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            began with the tea,&quot; the Hatter replied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of
                                            course twinkling begins with a T!&quot; said the King sharply. &quot;Do you
                                            take me for a dunce? Go on!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm a
                                            poor man,&quot; the Hatter went on, &quot;and most things twinkled after
                                            that—only the March Hare said——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            didn't!&quot; the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            did!&quot; said the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I deny it!&quot;
                                            said the March Hare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He denies it,&quot;
                                            said the King: &quot;leave out that part.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            at any rate, the Dormouse said——&quot; the Hatter went on, looking anxiously
                                            round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being
                                            fast asleep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After that,&quot; continued
                                            the Hatter, &quot;I cut some more bread-and-butter——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But
                                            what did the Dormouse say?&quot; one of the jury asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That
                                            I can't remember,&quot; said the Hatter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You
                                            must remember,&quot; remarked the King, &quot;or I'll have you executed.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on
                                            one knee. &quot;I'm a poor man, your Majesty,&quot; he began.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You're
                                            a very poor speaker,&quot; said the King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here one of the
                                            guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
                                            court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was
                                            done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
                                            into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm
                                            glad I've seen that done,&quot; thought Alice. &quot;I've so often read in
                                            the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempt at applause,
                                            which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,' and I never
                                            understood what it meant till now.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If
                                            that's all you know about it, you may stand down,&quot; continued the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I
                                            can't go no lower,&quot; said the Hatter: &quot;I'm on the floor, as it is.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            you may sit down,&quot; the King replied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here
                                            the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come,
                                            that finishes the guinea-pigs!&quot; thought Alice. &quot;Now we shall get
                                            on better.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'd rather finish my
                                            tea,&quot; said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was
                                            reading the list of singers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You may go,&quot;
                                            said the King; and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting
                                            to put his shoes on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;—and just take his
                                            head off outside,&quot; the Queen added to one of the officers; but the
                                            Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Call
                                            the next witness!&quot; said the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next
                                            witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and
                                            Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the
                                            people near the door began sneezing all at once.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Give
                                            your evidence,&quot; said the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sha'n't,&quot;
                                            said the cook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King looked anxiously at the
                                            White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, &quot;Your Majesty must cross-examine
                                            this witness.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, if I must, I
                                            must,&quot; the King said with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms
                                            and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in
                                            a deep voice, &quot;What are tarts made of?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Pepper,
                                            mostly,&quot; said the cook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Treacle,&quot;
                                            said a sleepy voice behind her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Collar
                                            that Dormouse,&quot; the Queen shrieked out. &quot;Behead that Dormouse!
                                            Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his
                                            whiskers.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some minutes the whole
                                            court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time
                                            they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never
                                            mind!&quot; said the King, with an air of great relief. &quot;Call the next
                                            witness.&quot; And he added in an undertone to the Queen, &quot;Really, my
                                            dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead
                                            ache!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice watched the White Rabbit as
                                            he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness
                                            would be like, &quot;—for they haven't got much evidence yet,&quot; she said
                                            to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
                                            of his shrill little voice, the name &quot;Alice!&quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</text>

        <chapterDescription __type="string">&quot;There!&quot; cried Alice, quite forgetting in
                                    the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
                                    jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her
                                    skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they
                                    lay sprawling about, ...

          <text __type="string">&lt;p&gt;THERE!&quot; cried Alice, quite forgetting in the
                                            flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and
                                            she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the
                                            edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd
                                            below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a
                                            globe of gold-fish she had accidentally upset the week before.&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Oh,
                                            I beg your pardon!&quot; she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began
                                            picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the
                                            gold-fish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that
                                            they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would
                                            die.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The trial cannot proceed,&quot; said
                                            the King in a very grave voice, &quot;until all the jurymen are back in
                                            their proper places—all,&quot; he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard
                                            at Alice as he said so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice looked at the
                                            jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head
                                            downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a
                                            melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and
                                            put it right; &quot;not that it signifies much,&quot; she said to herself;
                                            &quot;I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up
                                            as the other.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the jury had a
                                            little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils
                                            had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to
                                            write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too
                                            much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the
                                            roof of the court.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you know about
                                            this business?&quot; the King said to Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing,&quot;
                                            said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing whatever?&quot;
                                            persisted the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing whatever,&quot;
                                            said Alice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That's very important,&quot; the King
                                            said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on
                                            their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: &quot;Unimportant, your
                                            Majesty means, of course,&quot; he said in a very respectful tone, but
                                            frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unimportant,
                                            of course, I meant,&quot; the King hastily said, and went on himself in an
                                            undertone, &quot;important—unimportant—unimportant—important——&quot; as if
                                            he were trying which word sounded best.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of
                                            the jury wrote it down &quot;important,&quot; and some &quot;unimportant.&quot;
                                            Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
                                            &quot;but it doesn't matter a bit,&quot; she thought to herself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
                                            this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his
                                            note-book, called out &quot;Silence!&quot; and read out from his book,
                                            &quot;Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave the court.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody
                                            looked at Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm not a mile high,&quot;
                                            said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are,&quot; said the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nearly
                                            two miles high,&quot; added the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,
                                            I sha'n't go, at any rate,&quot; said Alice: &quot;besides, that's not a
                                            regular rule: you invented it just now.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's
                                            the oldest rule in the book,&quot; said the King.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then
                                            it ought to be Number One,&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. &quot;Consider your
                                            verdict,&quot; he said to the jury, in a low trembling voice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There's
                                            more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,&quot; said the White Rabbit,
                                            jumping up in a great hurry: &quot;this paper has just been picked up.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What's
                                            in it?&quot; said the Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I haven't
                                            opened it yet,&quot; said the White Rabbit, &quot;but it seems to be a
                                            letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            must have been that,&quot; said the King, &quot;unless it was written to
                                            nobody, which isn't usual, you know.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who
                                            is it directed to?&quot; said one of the jurymen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            isn't directed at all,&quot; said the White Rabbit; &quot;in fact, there's
                                            nothing written on the outside.&quot; He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
                                            added &quot;It isn't a letter after all: it's a set of verses.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are
                                            they in the prisoner's handwriting?&quot; asked another of the jurymen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,
                                            they're not,&quot; said the White Rabbit, &quot;and that's the queerest
                                            thing about it.&quot; (The jury all looked puzzled.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He
                                            must have imitated somebody else's hand,&quot; said the King. (The jury all
                                            brightened up again.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Please your
                                            Majesty,&quot; said the Knave, &quot;I didn't write it, and they can't prove
                                            that I did: there's no name signed at the end.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If
                                            you didn't sign it,&quot; said the King, &quot;that only makes the matter
                                            worse. You must have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your
                                            name like an honest man.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a
                                            general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the
                                            King had said that day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That proves his
                                            guilt, of course,&quot; said the Queen: &quot;so, off with——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It
                                            doesn't prove anything of the sort!&quot; said Alice. &quot;Why, you don't
                                            even know what they're about!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Read
                                            them,&quot; said the King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White Rabbit put on his
                                            spectacles. &quot;Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?&quot; he asked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Begin
                                            at the beginning,&quot; the King said gravely, &quot;and go on till you come
                                            to the end; then stop.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was dead
                                            silence in the court, whilst the White Rabbit read out these verses:—&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They
                                            told me you had been to her,&lt;br/&gt;And mentioned me to him:&lt;br/&gt;She
                                            gave me a good character,&lt;br/&gt;But said I could not swim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He
                                            sent them word I had not gone,&lt;br/&gt;(We know it to be true):&lt;br/&gt;If
                                            she should push the matter on,&lt;br/&gt;What would become of you?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
                                            gave her one, they gave him two,&lt;br/&gt;You gave us three or more;&lt;br/&gt;They
                                            all returned from him to you,&lt;br/&gt;Though they were mine before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If
                                            I or she should chance to be&lt;br/&gt;Involved in this affair,&lt;br/&gt;He
                                            trusts to you to set them free,&lt;br/&gt;Exactly as we were.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My
                                            notion was that you had been&lt;br/&gt;(Before she had this fit)&lt;br/&gt;An
                                            obstacle that came between&lt;br/&gt;Him, and ourselves, and it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't
                                            let him know she liked them best,&lt;br/&gt;For this must ever be&lt;br/&gt;A
                                            secret, kept from all the rest,&lt;br/&gt;Between yourself and me.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;That's
                                            the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,&quot; said the King,
                                            rubbing his hands; &quot;so now let the jury——&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If
                                            any of them can explain it,&quot; said Alice, (she had grown so large in the
                                            last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him,) &quot;I'll
                                            give him sixpence. I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            jury all wrote down on their slates, &quot;She doesn't believe there's an
                                            atom of meaning in it,&quot; but none of them attempted to explain the
                                            paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If there's no meaning in it,&quot;
                                            said the King, &quot;that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't
                                            try to find any. And yet I don't know,&quot; he went on, spreading out the
                                            verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; &quot;I seem to see
                                            some meaning in them after all. '——said I could not swim—' you can't swim
                                            can you?&quot; he added, turning to the Knave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
                                            Knave shook his head sadly. &quot;Do I look like it?&quot; he said. (Which
                                            he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;All
                                            right, so far,&quot; said the King, as he went on muttering over the verses
                                            to himself: &quot;'We know it to be true—' that's the jury, of course—'If
                                            she should push the matter on'—that must be the Queen—'What would become of
                                            you?'—What, indeed!—'I gave her one, they gave him two—' why, that must be
                                            what he did with the tarts, you know——&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But it
                                            goes on 'they all returned from him to you,'&quot; said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why,
                                            there they are!&quot; said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on
                                            the table. &quot;Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again—'before she
                                            had this fit—' you never had fits, my dear, I think?&quot; he said to the
                                            Queen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never!&quot; said the Queen
                                            furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate
                                            little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found
                                            it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
                                            trickling down his face, as long
                                            as it lasted.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then the words don't fit you,&quot;
                                            said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead
                                            silence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It's a pun!&quot; the King added
                                            in an angry tone, and everybody laughed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let
                                            the jury consider their verdict,&quot; the King said, for about the
                                            twentieth time that day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, no!&quot;
                                            said the Queen. &quot;Sentence first—verdict afterwards.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stuff
                                            and nonsense!&quot; said Alice loudly. &quot;The idea of having the sentence
                                            first!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hold your tongue!&quot; said
                                            the Queen, turning purple.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I won't!&quot;
                                            said Alice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Off with her head!&quot; the
                                            Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who
                                            cares for you?&quot; said Alice (she had grown to her full size by this
                                            time). &quot;You're nothing but a pack of cards!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At
                                            this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she
                                            gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat
                                            them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of
                                            her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered
                                            down from the trees upon her face.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wake
                                            up, Alice dear!&quot; said her sister. &quot;Why, what a long sleep you've
                                            had!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, I've had such a curious
                                            dream!&quot; said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could
                                            remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been
                                            reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said
                                            &quot;It was a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea;
                                            it's getting late.&quot; So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
                                            ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUT
                                            her sister sat still just as she had left her, leaning her head, watching
                                            the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful
                                            Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her
                                            dream:&lt;br/&gt;First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again
                                            the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
                                            looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see
                                            that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
                                            would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to
                                            listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
                                            of her little sister's dream.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long grass
                                            rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse
                                            splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of
                                            the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending
                                            meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests
                                            to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess' knee, while
                                            plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the
                                            squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed
                                            guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
                                            Mock Turtle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she sat on with closed eyes,
                                            and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open
                                            them again, and all would change to dull reality—the grass would be only
                                            rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the
                                            rattling teacups would change to the tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's
                                            shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby,
                                            the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
                                            knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the
                                            cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly,
                                            she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the
                                            after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all
                                            her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she
                                            would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and
                                            eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of
                                            long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a
                                            pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the
                                            happy summer days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;THE END &lt;/h4&gt;</text>
